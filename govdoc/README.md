# Govdoc Format

`govdoc-typst` is a Quarto Typst format extension for formatting documents in compliance with the GB/T 9704-2012 standard.

## Installing

You can install the format extension with a `qmd` template file that you can use as a starting place for your document.

```

or you can install the format extension only and without the template qmd file.
