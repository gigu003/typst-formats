## Installing

You can install the format extension and create an example qmd file
that you can use as a starting place for your document.

```bash
quarto use template gigu003/typst-formats/qsight
```

or you can install the clean version extension without qmd file.

```bash
quarto install extension gigu003/typst-formats/qsight
```
